# Overview
This repository contains code for a machine learning regression problem aimed at predicting the age of crustaceans using a set of features. The goal is to create an accurate model that can reliably predict the age of crustaceans given specific input features.

# Model
GradientBoostRegressor

# Features
Sex - Gender of the Crustacean- Male, Female, and Indeterminate.
Measures - Contains the Length, Diameter, and Height of the Crustacean stored in a tuple.
Weights - Contains the weights of the Shell, Shucked, and Viscera.

# Target Variable
Age - Contains the Age of the Crustacean. This is the value that needs to be predicted..
